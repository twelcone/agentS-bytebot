Now I want to run Agent-S with OSWorld benchmark, I already hosted UI-TARS-1.5-7B with docker vLLM on a server
But the plan is, first I want to know the way how bybote is control the bytebot VM (cause bytebot VM is a complete linux machine so I want Agent-S can control that linux machine)

Analyze carefully and come up with a plan (ask me for any uncertain points)
